    Script for Interacting with the DeepSeek API

Description:
-------------
This script interacts with the DeepSeek API to submit queries and retrieve answers.
The model configuration, including API endpoint, authorization token, and other settings,
are loaded from a JSON configuration file ('model.json').

The script does the following:
1. Loads model configuration from 'model.json'.
2. Sends a query to the DeepSeek API using the loaded configuration.
3. Receives and prints the answer from the API.

Dependencies:
-------------
- json
- requests

Usage:
------
1. Place your 'model.json' in the same directory as the script.
2. Ensure that the API URL and token are correctly configured in 'model.json'.
3. Run the script to see the answer returned by the DeepSeek API.

Example:
--------
Run the script to ask a question such as:
"Explain the Lean theorem process step by step."

Note:
-----
Ensure your API token is kept secure and not shared publicly.
